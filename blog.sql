Yet, in celebrating such new capabilities in technology,&nbsp;people have to be careful not to&nbsp;lose touch with reality. They shouldn\'t try to disrupt a market entirely through a new app. We don\'t, after all, live in a purely digital world; this isn\'t&nbsp;<em>The Matrix.</em>&nbsp;And, the last time I checked, Keanu Reeves wasn&rsquo;t our anointed savior.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/16x9/822/20170615224932-GettyImages-641074040.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"462\" /></p>\r\n<div class=\"teadsNative\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>The question I\'m posing here&nbsp;is, if new technology isn&rsquo;t supported by physical infrastructure, what&rsquo;s the point? Digitally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping/time/service/value_added/del_intercept.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">redirecting a UPS package</a>&nbsp;does nothing if there aren&rsquo;t workers on the ground who can update the address label on the box. Entrepreneurs who overlook the physical world will never change it. Furthermore, they must be able to identify when markets are primed for disruption if they want to be the ones driving major innovation.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Pinpointing markets ripe for disruption</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, there are two conditions that indicate a market space is ready for a new behavior to replace tried-and-true methods: maturation and fragmentation.</p>\r\n<p>A mature market has a relatively stable structure in terms of the size of firms, the number of startups and the composition of businesses. In these markets, cumbents and customers alike tend to consider it fairly obvious how to run businesses. If&nbsp;people utter&nbsp;phrases like, &ldquo;This is how it&rsquo;s always been done,&rdquo; that\'s a good indicator that that market is mature.</p>\r\n<p>Innovation becomes an afterthought, and companies tend to all move in the same direction.</p>\r\n<p>The smartphone marketplace, for example,&nbsp;hasn&rsquo;t dramatically changed since the first iPhone hit the scene 10 years ago. Phones have become increasingly faster and possess new bells and whistles, but they&rsquo;ll likely be replaced soon by a next-generation device that will &ldquo;change everything.&rdquo; Rumors are already swirling that Microsoft&rsquo;s planned&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bgr.com/2017/05/03/microsoft-surface-phone-smartphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Surface Phone could disrupt the market</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Which brings us to fragmentation. Mature markets are stagnant, while&nbsp;<em>fragmented</em> markets have numerous solutions, but no obvious leader. A fragmented market lacks streamlining and standardization, so disruption entails&nbsp;an introduction of something new, rather than the end of an era. In that scenario, disruption serves as a unifier -- innovation that bridges, adds to&nbsp;or partially replaces solutions. This is a common occurrence in technology, where a newly adopted standard can have a ripple effect.</p>\r\n<p>Returning to the smartphone example, that marketplace was already fairly fragmented a decade ago. After Apple changed the game by introducing the iPhone, other companies followed suit with similar devices. The lesson? Once you&rsquo;ve pinpointed a market that&rsquo;s ready for disruption, it&rsquo;s time to figure out how to use a combination of hardware and software to stir things up.</p>', '2017-06-17 14:59:08'),
(81, 'Why Entrepreneurs Should Aim to Fail -- That\'s Right. They Should Actively Seek It.', 'When you come out of a tough situation and realize you weren\'t crushed by it, you\'ll be stronger.', 'finance and business', 'Why Entrepreneurs Should Aim to Fail', '<div id=\"contentsContainer\">\r\n<div id=\"contents\">\r\n<p>Here\'s a viewpoint that might cause&nbsp;you to do a double take:&nbsp;<em>Actively</em> seeking rejection means you\'re learning, adapting and getting that much closer to your destination.</p>\r\n<div class=\"island-ad adbox\" data-key=\"had\" data-sizes=\"{ \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>Before you click away, just think about this a moment: Entrepreneurs are innovators: They defy conventional wisdom to find ways to improve it, and they challenge assumptions to approach a given industry or need from a unique perspective. They&nbsp;live at the intersection of innovation and practicality. For them, failure is a necessity to reach success.</p>\r\n<div class=\"teadsNative\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>So, maybe failure\'s \"teachable moments\" are actually worth striving for because they help you attain that innovation.</p>\r\n<p>Two entrepreneurs in Michigan have recently explored this idea. And, as a result, they\'ve&nbsp;<a id=\"E59\" href=\"http://www.rapidgrowthmedia.com/features/failureaslife.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">taken the embrace of failure&nbsp;to the next level</a>: Jordan O&rsquo;Neil and Jonathan Williams co-founded <a id=\"E62\" href=\"http://failure-lab.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Failure Lab</a>, an event that actually encourages participants to share stories of their biggest failures in their personal, academic and professional lives. The two men emphasize that the event isn&rsquo;t just about comparing failures -- it&rsquo;s an exercise in learning from them and becoming more resilient after them.</p>\r\n<p>Each failure an entrepreneur encounters is a lesson; it&rsquo;s a learning experience to help grow and succeed on the next attempt -- and the attempt after that. Accepting failures as a critical element of doing business is essential for entrepreneurs on the path to success. Here are the steps to take on that path:</p>\r\n<h2>Actively seek rejection.</h2>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m an advisor for several companies and fellow entrepreneurs. Working with entrepreneurs is one of my passions, and as an active angel investor, I speak with startup entrepreneurs and founders regularly. In short, I&rsquo;ve seen many people -- including myself -- experience failure.</p>\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not a bad thing: Getting rejected means we&rsquo;ve taken action to get ourselves closer to our destination and enables us to learn and adapt. Consider this &ldquo;fail&rdquo; acronym: <strong>F</strong>requent <strong>A</strong>daptation <strong>I</strong>nspires<strong> L</strong>earning. It\'s about&nbsp;changing your perspective and how you see failure.</p>\r\n<p>In his book<em> <a id=\"E92\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>,</em>&nbsp;Daniel Kahneman, whose work in cognitive neuroscience and rationality earned him the Nobel Prize in economics, unraveled human thinking. He described the many &ldquo;cognitive biases&rdquo; that people live with; he illuminated how our brains seek to reduce complexities into familiar, simplistic alternatives. While this thinking pattern might be helpful for someone going about a daily routine, it can stifle innovation. When it comes to entrepreneurship, there must be&nbsp;a willingness to experiment.</p>\r\n<p>Failure, in other words,&nbsp;helps inform the thought process behind experimentation. Sometimes, the only way to know how an idea will work out is to try it. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, that result&nbsp;signals that it&rsquo;s time for a new approach.</p>\r\n<h2>Approach failure like a lesson.</h2>\r\n<p>Success requires the ability to execute. Most of the time, the actions required of an entrepreneur make rejection a distinct possibility. Room for failure exists everywhere, from learning something new, to selling products, to asking for venture capital, to <a id=\"E107\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow noopener\">taking out a business loan</a>&nbsp;-- and even to telling friends and family about a new idea. But the next time you&rsquo;re facing a meeting or experience that might go downhill, remember these benefits you can take from rejection:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><strong>Benefit: You&rsquo;ll feel the fear but move forward anyway.</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Through a mutual acquaintance, I recently connected with an aspiring fashion entrepreneur. She wanted to launch a shoe line and asked me for advice on how to start her business. She confided to me that rejection -- failing to sell the shoes she designed -- was her biggest fear. My advice to her was simple: Feel the fear, and do it anyway.</p>', '2017-06-17 15:11:21'),

There are tens of thousands of artists vying for attention and gigs, and that\'s on top of the&nbsp;artistic challenge of getting the inspiration for new songs, finding the right melody or beat, and dealing with band member personalities.&nbsp;The whole process can be overwhelming, especially considering&nbsp;the constant flux the music industry presents.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But, explains composer and producer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Alejandro\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rodney Alejandro</a>, &ldquo;No band ever became successful by accident. It took passion, planning&nbsp;and persistence.\" Despite the thousands of tips on joining the music industry readily available online, knowing where to start is something completely different. To help you, I&rsquo;m going to share essential tips on how to make a long-term career in the music industry that you can start implementing right now.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>1. Create something your audience will love.</strong></h2>\r\n<p>To truly have a lucrative career, you must create music an audience wants to hear. \"Gone are the days of record labels creating rock stars,&rdquo; says producer <a href=\"http://www.jaydemonroe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Julie Pyle</a> of Jayde Monroe Productions. &ldquo;To be successful in the industry today, a band must act as its own CEO and create a strong and unique brand.\" It&rsquo;s vital to channel your passion to find the right sound, genre, topics, image, and target audience for the music you create. Your music brand is no different than any other, so it\'s vital that you do adequate market research to know:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Where&nbsp;is your audience?&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>How old is your audience?&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>What music do they currently listen to?&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>What do they want to hear more of?&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>What do they hate?</li>\r\n<li>Where do they listen to music?&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Where&nbsp;do they buy their music?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><strong>2. Help them relate to your brand</strong>.</h2>\r\n<p>Despite your creative flare, your desire to be unique, and perhaps your lack of care for pleasing the masses, you are no different to any other brand -- meaning you have to be likable. For your audience to take an interest in you, you need to first create good music, and second, portray yourself in a way that your audience can relate to. Be personable, show personality, and portray yourself as an authority figure in the industry by leading the curve.</p>\r\n<p>Mike Varney of <a href=\"http://www.shrapnelrecords.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shrapnel Records</a> says this about creating your own personal style: &ldquo;There is always a curve in each genre of music and you have to be careful not to jump on an existing bandwagon that is phasing out. You take the chance of falling behind the curve, as other bands who are more cutting edge shape the industry. Hopefully, you can see the curve and naturally create music which will be perceived as fresh and not a rehash of what has been popular in the previous years.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>. Promote your music on the right online channels.</strong></h2>\r\n<p>You need to promote yourself online, of course, but it\'s more important that you choose the right channels to do so. Having a website and maintaining an active presence on social media are both essential, but you also need to make sure you appear on Spotify specifically. Spotify is dominating the online music industry and if you can get yourself into one person&rsquo;s playlist, others will follow.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>4. Promote your music offline, too.</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Online is where you will reach your largest audience and following, but the radio still plays a very important role in the music industry.</p>\r\n<p>Once you are established in your city, and you\'ve played a lot of gigs and gotten to know people, ask local DJs if they will spin your record. Once local DJs are playing your songs, bigger market radio stations will likely follow suit.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from having your songs on the radio, you should also aim to get some air time doing interviews and playing live sets. Ask for interviews on local radio stations that coincide with big gigs, which will help you not only get the word out about your show, but also get you more exposure on the radio. Interviews&nbsp;will help your audience relate to you as a person and show them that you are more than just another name.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>5. Prepare for a bumpy road.</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Remember, you need to earn a living while making your fortune from your music -- it&rsquo;s feast or famine in the music industry so prepare for the worst while expecting the best. Consider keeping your day job while you write new songs, play live gigs&nbsp;and establish yourself in the music community in your town. Once you start seeing an income solely from your music, you can dump everything else and invest yourself fully.</p>\r\n<p>Nothing happens overnight, and that goes for making it in the music industry. You need to be prepared to stick with it for the long haul -- sometimes 10 to 20 years, maybe more. You also need to know that financial times may be tough during your journey but that with one break, it could all be worth it. But, says <a href=\"http://www.alexgrossimusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex Grossi</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_Riot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quiet Riot</a>, &ldquo;If you truly love music and want it badly enough, anything is possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>6. Diversify to stay alive.</strong></h2>\r\n<p>If you decide to quit your job to pursue your music professionally, you need to find ways to make money that will allow you to progress. Aside from getting your name out there and networking with the right people at relevant music industry events and gigs, you could also start giving music lessons, play&nbsp;weddings and other events, run sound for gigs around town, and/or learn how to produce other local artists.</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>', '2017-06-17 15:16:57'),
(84, 'What Gary Vaynerchuk Learned by Experimenting on Himself', 'Gary Vaynerchuk is half man, half brand, half digital experiment. And somehow, that all adds up.', 'gossip', 'What Gary Vaynerchuk Learned by Experimenting on Himself', '<p><img src=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/16x9/822/20170518183800-gary-vaynerchuk-hero1.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Gary Vaynerchuk arrives at his Manhattan office at 8 a.m. There&rsquo;s no slow ascent -- no sipping coffee while scrolling through emails, no idle chitchat to forestall the onslaught of responsibility. Instead, as he does every morning, he quickly huddles with the two people who will accompany him throughout the day: his personal assistant, which is typical of most executives, and his personal videographer, which is, let&rsquo;s just say, a profoundly Gary Vaynerchuk kind of role.</p>\r\n<p>The assistant, Tyler Schmitt, runs Vaynerchuk through the day&rsquo;s schedule. There are 24 meetings, including check-ins with the staff and clients of his digital media agency, <a href=\"http://vaynermedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VaynerMedia</a>, as well as a wild assortment of guests -- <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281657\">social media stars</a>, athletes, actors, musicians, many with entourages in tow. As usual, the action will be captured by the videographer, David Rock, nicknamed D-Rock. When the time comes, D-Rock will raise his camera, train it on his boss&nbsp;and barely take it off him all day, except during sensitive client meetings.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;All right, you guys ready?&rdquo; the 41-year-old CEO says to Rock and Schmitt, who are now standing with a few other members of what, internally, is known as either Team Gary or Gary&rsquo;s Team -- a 16-member group that also includes a brand director, designers, merchandisers, influencer marketers and business developers. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start the show.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>At 8:10, the guests start arriving. There&rsquo;s an <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281597\">interview</a> with a potential executive hire, a podcast recording with <a href=\"http://digg.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digg</a> founder Kevin Rose, a talk with a young Dallas entrepreneur who won face-to-face time with Vaynerchuk in a Twitter competition. Then another meeting, and another, in blocks of five minutes up to an hour, with Vaynerchuk gesturing, laughing, swearing freely, peppering each visitor with questions&nbsp;and offering assessments. &ldquo;You need a teammate, so let the things you aren&rsquo;t gravitating to yourself lead you to the partner you&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; he tells Daina Falk, creator of the <a href=\"http://www.hungryfan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hungry Fan</a> sports tailgating site and cookbook, who is working to manage her <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand&rsquo;s growth</a>. &ldquo;I really do think Facebook is Netflix&rsquo;s biggest competitor, so listen -- write a TV show, but do it on Facebook,&rdquo; he tells Greg Davis, Jr., a.k.a. Klarity, a 32-year-old actor who wants to expand his social following.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1495132379_gary-vaynerchuk-4.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Vaynerchuk\" /></p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a string of internal confabs. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m the bottleneck, let&rsquo;s try a meeting where everyone hurls questions at me and I can only say yes or no, just to clear up the things that get clogged,&rdquo; he suggests to his management team. (They try it two days later. It doesn&rsquo;t work; Vaynerchuk talks too much.) There&rsquo;s the surprisingly businesslike crew from hit Instagram meme-machine <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fuckjerry/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FuckJerry</a>, reps from the NHL, a Los Angeles style blogger and rapper Sean Combs&rsquo; social media team. &ldquo;Diddy&rsquo;s trying to reach a new audience,&rdquo; says Deon Graham, the boss. Vaynerchuk is all over it. &ldquo;Puff has energy, so let&rsquo;s give your new team the reins on <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/287332\">new ideas</a>,&rdquo; he says. The ideas themselves will come after a dinner meeting between Combs and Vaynerchuk, which Graham vows to set up. After a round of the requisite selfies, which almost every visitor takes with Vaynerchuk, they bounce. More meetings convene. Scheduled ones, impromptu ones, conference room drop-ins, Sorkin-esque walk-and-talks. I ask Schmitt, the personal assistant, what happens if someone cancels a meeting. He looks at me blankly. &ldquo;He finds a meeting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Through it all, Rock is a persistent fly on the wall, training his DSLR on the action. Sometimes he&rsquo;s in the room, sometimes he grabs scenes from outside the glass partition, moving the camera around for dramatic effect. Originally, Rock produced this reality show himself -- filming and editing the videos of Vaynerchuk and uploading them to social. Now he has a team of videographers, which speeds the turnaround. The meetings I witness today will be cut up, subtitled, set to a beat and released tomorrow as a show called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfA33-E9P7FA-A72QKBw3noWuQbaVXqSD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DailyVee</a> on YouTube (to Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s 645,000 subscribers) or in quick hits on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyvee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> (nearly 1.4 million followers) and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/garyvee/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> (1.7 million).</p>\r\n<p>The clips tend to capture Vaynerchuk frenetically hammering home his favored themes -- focus on your strengths, work your ass off, spot the next big shift and get there first, stop obsessing over stuff that doesn&rsquo;t matter, be the bigger person, give more than you get&nbsp;and above all, execute. All this output, plus his relentless social media engagement and videos where he answers viewers&rsquo; questions, has fostered an ever-growing group of fans who treat him as an all-knowing sensei, enamored with his ability to cut right to the heart of their problems. And that, in turn, has turned him into an entrepreneurial celebrity. In addition to the videos, he pumps out books, podcasts&nbsp;and many conference keynotes, and is now costarring in Apple&rsquo;s first-ever original TV series -- a tech-based reality competition called Planet of the Apps -- alongside Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow&nbsp;and will.i.am. Last spring when he tweeted that he was in London and offered to meet with followers, 200 people converged on a city park, all hoping to pick his brain, #AskGaryVee-style. (That would be his YouTube Q&amp;A show, of course.)</p>\r\n<p>This high profile has also drawn a different, less flattering kind of attention. The world of entrepreneurship is, to be frank about it, full of hucksters -- people who had one business success, or maybe skipped that part entirely and went directly into wisdom-spouting mode. To the polished bosses of old business in their sepulchral C-suites, Vaynerchuk can look a lot like King Huckster himself. After all, who the hell is so sure of their golden word that they&rsquo;d pay a videographer to tail them?</p>\r\n<p>Vaynerchuk insists this doesn&rsquo;t bother him. &ldquo;Underestimating me is what I fucking live for,&rdquo; he says. And anyway, to dismiss Vaynerchuk is to overlook something important about how to build a brand today. He is the living, breathing version of what digital marketing can do -- because once he started mainlining himself into the internet, it helped him be a successful entrepreneur, which made him a celebrity, which helped him become an even more successful entrepreneur, which made him an even bigger celebrity, with each part feeding the other. His net worth has grown to $160 million, and his fast-growing agency now employs more than 700 people and pulled in $100 million last year.</p>\r\n<p>Gary Vaynerchuk is, in other words, what every brand wants out of social media. He connects and excites and inspires loyalty. So, the thinking goes, if brands want all this -- to connect and excite and inspire loyalty -- they should be more like Gary Vaynerchuk.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1495132400_gary-vaynerchuk-2.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Vaynerchuk\" /></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>If you&rsquo;ve ever heard</strong> Vaynerchuk interviewed, you&rsquo;ve likely heard him tell his origin story -- in which a small-time wine guy discovers the power of digital marketing. But the tale is really more than that; it&rsquo;s about how a small-time wine guy realizes the power of personality. His father, Sasha, took over an anonymous New Jersey liquor store in the early 1980s, shortly after emigrating from the then Soviet Union, where his son was born in 1975. Vaynerchuk assumed operations after college in 1998 and began experimenting. He rebranded the store as the Wine Library, then initiated online sales and fired off weekly emails to customers with special deals -- both pioneering moves at the time. Sales grew from $4 million annually to $45 million in just five years.</p>\r\n<p>Entrepreneurs will often say that constraints are valuable -- that they force people to be creative. Wine was Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s constraint. Alcohol is hard to market; there are regulations about advertising, serving&nbsp;and transporting it. But, he realized, there were no restrictions on marketing himself talking about wine. In early 2006, barely a year after YouTube launched, Vaynerchuk created a daily show on the platform called Wine Library TV. He turned out to be a natural communicator, something he attributes to growing up trying to understand his father. &ldquo;My dad doesn&rsquo;t talk. He literally doesn&rsquo;t talk. The human does not speak,&rdquo; Vaynerchuk jokes. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve had to spend my life trying to extract from him what he was thinking and feeling.&rdquo; This turned out to be a valuable skill, because marketing, by its very nature, requires the same sort of intuition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You must infer and analyze based on small, stray amounts of feedback. You listen, in effect, by speaking and listening for echoes.</p>\r\n<p>Wine Library TV earned him coverage in <em>Time</em>, an appearance on <em>Late Night with Conan O&rsquo;Brien</em>&nbsp;and a book deal. It also made him itch for a bigger platform. The YouTube show gradually evolved into conversations about business and entrepreneurship. His followers became more interested in marketing than merlot. At that point, wine became a constraint that was no longer valuable. &ldquo;I had so many ideas but couldn&rsquo;t execute them all at the Wine Library,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/285557\" data-ctorig=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/285557\" data-cturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/285557&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ2ZOgrfzTAhUhIsAKHR7FBn8QFggLMAI&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9SGzA3sR7SaMVEkw4OLLruy7fKQ\">12 Secrets to Supercharging Your&nbsp;Personal Brand</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>This, it seems, is where Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s philosophy crystallized. Like every marketer, he originally thought he needed somebody&rsquo;s product to sell. A marketer without a brand to manage seemed like a bricklayer with no bricks to lay. But the digital revolution changed that. It may be an old observation now, but what Wine Library TV taught Vaynerchuk back then was still a revelation: People could be brands. He could be a brand. And by treating himself like one, he could fashion himself into a walking, talking R&amp;D lab, testing his more forward-thinking marketing theories on himself, without having to gain some client&rsquo;s permission first. Then, if his personal brand took off, he could package those theories and strategies and sell them to clients, in effect helping them be more like Gary Vaynerchuk. &ldquo;I never actually set out wanting to be a personal brand, leveraging that to sell my own stuff,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Instead it&rsquo;s how I learned my craft, by being the plumber and the electrician and the general contractor. I got to test my beliefs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>One of those beliefs became this: Provide value over and over again -- educate, entertain, enlighten -- and then present your &ldquo;ask&rdquo; to the audience. Subscribe to my channel. Buy some wine. Read my book. (He&rsquo;d go on to spell this out in his 2013 book Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. The jabs are the value; the right hooks are the asks.) So he handed control of the wine shop back to his father and began preparing for his biggest ask yet: If you like my social media insights so much, hire me to execute them on your behalf. In 2009, Vaynerchuk and his brother AJ launched VaynerMedia.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.entrepreneur.com/images/misc/1495132419_gary-vaynerchuk-1.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Vaynerchuk\" /></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>In its first few years</strong>, as Vaynerchuk transitioned away from the wine operation, VaynerMedia lingered in double-digit personnel and a few million per year in revenue. With time, however, came traction. The company opened offices in Los Angeles, Chattanooga&nbsp;and London. It signed bigger and bigger brands. Last year revenues were up 50 percent over the previous year, to $100 million. In 2016 it moved into shiny new digs in a massive Manhattan high-rise to house the agency, a newly launched investment fund (<a href=\"http://vaynerrse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vayner/RSE</a>)&nbsp;and a two-year-old sports agency (<a href=\"http://vaynersports.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VaynerSports</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The VaynerMedia office is a spectacle. It contains endless rows of open-space desks populated by more than 700 strategists, marketing experts&nbsp;and business-development personnel -- most of them young and few with typical agency backgrounds -- who manage clients&rsquo; digital marketing campaigns, influencer programs, e-commerce strategies and technology integration, as well as personal brand development for celebrities, CEOs, artists and athletes. The staff also includes 200 writers, designers, photographers&nbsp;and animators, all focused on helping large companies and huge stars act more like their boss.</p>\r\n<p>Here, on a grand scale, is where Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s philosophy that what works for a one-man brand can translate to the world&rsquo;s largest companies -- including General Electric, Unilever, Diageo, Toyota&nbsp;and Chase -- is put to the test. Louis Colon III, director of the Heritage line at Fila North America, says Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s strategic personal touch on social resonated immediately. &ldquo;Gary understands firsthand what it is to be an underdog and an entrepreneur,&rdquo; Colon says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a highly competitive industry in footwear and apparel, and for us to stand out, he helped develop a cadence of interesting storytelling that keeps the consumers&rsquo; attention.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s meant a steady stream of product launches amplified through social media placements and collaborations with athletes, artists&nbsp;and retailers, on their channels and Fila&rsquo;s. &ldquo;We never ask for the sale, we just ask to be a part of the conversation and to have the consumers&rsquo; attention.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And what does a brand do with all that attention? It engages. Through Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s personal brand-building, he&rsquo;s found that heavy engagement -- replying basically to everyone who reaches out -- boosts not just your following but also your reputation. Today, 85 percent of his 135,000 tweets are replies. He wrote a book about this, 2011&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thank-You-Economy-Gary-Vaynerchuk/dp/0061914185/?&amp;tag=entrepreneurcom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Thank You Economy</em></a><em>,</em> and the point is reproven on social all the time.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes his clients need more than content help; they need to be awakened to the breadth of digital possibility. When Toyota hired Vaynerchuk to help with social strategy, it wasn&rsquo;t leveraging new social tools or platforms fast enough. &ldquo;Gary&rsquo;s point was that anyone marketing for today is a full day behind. That opened everyone&rsquo;s mind up,&rdquo; says Jack Hollis, a group vice president and general manager at Toyota Motor North America. Vaynerchuk pushed them to be in new places first. Facebook video could become as significant as TV ads, he said. Demographically appealing influencers should be hired to help market specific car models, rather than brand-wide. Toyota did so, and entered Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat in ways it hadn&rsquo;t before -- even as Vaynerchuk warned that the clock was ticking fast on every new strategy.</p>\r\n<p>But as VaynerMedia helps teach brands what it knows, Vaynerchuk is also creating a pipeline for ideas to come in -- so that he&rsquo;s learning from the next generation of social stars. This is a big part of why he so happily meets non-clients in his office. During that endless-meeting day, for example, he sat down with Farokh Sarmad, the 22-year-old founder of a luxury lifestyle Instagram feed and website called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrgoodlife.co/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mr. Goodlife</a>. The guy had racked up millions of followers, but he wanted Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s advice on growing his business further. Vaynerchuk sensed a mutual opportunity, so he began a trade. First he provided value. Rely less on Instagram, he told Sarmad, because at any moment the platform could change its terms and screw him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you build infrastructure to be independent,&rdquo; Vaynerchuk said. Then he made his ask. &ldquo;I want to siphon off as much exposure as possible from your audience. When we meet again, be prepared to have that meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>', '2017-06-17 15:30:28'),

That stung ever since, and even Durant understood, because he gave up the same lead to the Warriors a round earlier with Oklahoma City.</p>\r\n<div data-reactid=\"218\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4\" data-reactid=\"219\">\"We learned from everything we\'ve been through,\" Curry said during the trophy celebration. \"Our perspective, being blessed to play on this stage three years in a row, it\'s for these fans, for our organization, for these families.

I grew up obsessed with <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/29/wrestlemania-how-a-grapple-hating-suplex-phobe-finally-got-wwe\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">WWE</a>, Fight Club is my favourite film and I remember watching Holyfield v Tyson, aged seven. But, until savate (pronounced &ldquo;savat&rdquo;), I had never done so much as a kickboxing class.</p>\r\n<p>I stumbled on savate by accident. At the start of 2016, I had a lifestyle overhaul, gave up alcohol and cigarettes and started running more. Soon, running wasn&rsquo;t enough. I searched for kickboxing classes in my area and found the London savate club. I had never heard of it. The site called it an &ldquo;elegant kickboxing sport from France&rdquo;. Kickboxing? Elegant? I was intrigued.</p>\r\n<p>Savate combines French kicks &ndash; such as a <em>fouett&eacute;</em> (a whip or roundhouse kick) &ndash; with English boxing. There are two types of competition: combat and assaut. Combat savate is full contact, in which you are looking to knock out your opponent. In assaut savate, the kind practised in most UK clubs, excessive force is forbidden. Yes, you aim to kick and punch your opponent, but you don&rsquo;t try to knock their head off, only to make contact. You score points for touches and the winner is the fighter who demonstrates the best technique and control. Not fearing for my face means I can think more strategically to anticipate my opponent&rsquo;s attacks and work out how to counter them. It is in equal parts a mental and a physical workout.</p>\r\n<p>The fights range from three 1.5-minute rounds up to five two-minute rounds, with a minute&rsquo;s rest between rounds. I was nervous at first, but when nervous energy mixes with adrenaline and becomes an exciting, fast-paced and challenging bout, it makes me want to come back for more.</p>\r\n<p>Savate has given me some incredible opportunities. In the past year, I&rsquo;ve passed my blue and green glove gradings, travelled to Ireland and Hungary for competitions, become a British vice-champion and joined the GB squad. All without getting a single black eye.</p>\r\n<h2>My weekend workout</h2>\r\n<p><strong>How often do you train?</strong> I train twice a week, run twice a week and fit in a weights session if I can. <br /><strong>Favourite move?</strong> <em>Fouett&eacute; figure </em>&ndash; a lovely French way of saying a kick to the head.</p>\r\n<h2>Five ways to get started</h2>\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad--inline1\" class=\"js-ad-slot ad-slot ad-slot--inline ad-slot--inline1 u-h ad-slot--rendered\" data-link-name=\"ad slot inline1\" data-name=\"inline1\" data-mobile=\"1,1|2,2|300,250|fluid\" data-desktop=\"1,1|2,2|300,250|620,1|620,350|fluid\" data-google-query-id=\"CJv8sJuAxdQCFXAC0wodT8EFFg\">\r\n<div class=\"ad-slot__label\">Advertisement</div>\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/59666047/theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/ng_0__container__\" class=\"ad-slot__content\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/59666047/theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/ng_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/59666047/theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/ng_0\" width=\"620\" height=\"1\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-integralas-id-da756e28-64c0-0dfb-22a6-ca0a9c2540df=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><strong>1 </strong>Find an authentic savate club. Many martial artists put savate on their CV, but fewer have trained with bone fide practitioners or have ever got into the ring. The Great Britain Savate Federation lists clubs with qualified instructors at <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://www.savate.org.uk/clubs\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">savate.org.uk</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2 </strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about being fit and flexible before starting. Well-run beginner classes won&rsquo;t expect you to be <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bruce-lee\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Bruce Lee</a> on your first night. Training makes you fitter &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t presuppose fitness.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3 </strong>Get in touch with a local savate club about watching a class to see what it is all about.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4 </strong>Boots are the most important piece of kit. The word savate refers to the boot worn by practitioners of old. It is hard to get hold of genuine savate boots in the UK, but a boxing boot without jagged edges or rough soles is similar.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5 </strong>Don&rsquo;t worry about getting your head smashed in on your first night. Savate is a contact sport, but a good club won&rsquo;t ask you to spar until you are ready.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<figure id=\"img-2\" class=\"element element-image img--landscape  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" data-component=\"image\" data-media-id=\"0eee0e6024be1d24fc91dbee30bc578d08eae0a4\"></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '2017-06-17 15:40:26'),

While the additional risk was small for women who were just above the healthy weight range, the progressive increase in risk made the researchers more confident that the link was causal.</p>\r\n<p>Martin Neovius, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute and the study&rsquo;s senior author, said: &ldquo;In terms of risk, it is better to be normal weight than overweight and much better to be normal weight than obese.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Writing in the <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j2563\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">British Medical Journal</a>, the researchers urged women who are planning pregnancy to aim to get their weight within the healthy range before conception.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Efforts should be made to encourage women of reproductive age to adopt a healthy lifestyle and to obtain a normal body weight before conception,&rdquo; the authors wrote.</p>\r\n<p>Neovius added that the sliding scale of risk suggests that even decreasing from severe obesity to milder obesity would have a benefit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard for someone of a BMI of 42 to become normal weight,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The study found that a total of 43,550 babies (3.5% of all births) had major congenital malformations. Compared with mothers in the healthy weight range (3.4% risk of defects), the risk was 3.5% for overweight mothers, 3.8 for obese mothers, and rose to 4.2% and 4.7% for higher categories of obesity.</p>\r\n<p>The categories were based on body mass index (BMI), with a healthy weight defined as a BMI between 18.5 and 24, overweight being 25 to 29, and obese being 30 or over.</p>\r\n<p>The researchers took into account a range of potential confounding factors, and their findings are strongly suggestive &ndash; although not absolute proof &ndash;of a causal link. Scientists are still trying to understand how maternal weight impacts the developing foetus.</p>\r\n<p>Altered hormone levels, higher levels of inflammation and less efficient delivery of nutrients via the placenta could all play a role, the paper suggests. Poor blood sugar control was cited as another potential risk factor, although the link remained when those diagnosed with diabetes were excluded.</p>\r\n<p>Another possible contributor is that overweight women have been shown previously to be less likely to take folic acid supplements, which are know to protect against certain birth defects. The latest study was not able to control for this possibility.</p>\r\n<p>Neovius said that the risk of birth defects was just one of many of additional risk factors faced in pregnancy by women who are obese.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Severe obesity confers excess risk for so many other negative outcomes for pregnancy: pre-eclampsia, diabetes, still-birth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not a good place to be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He acknowledged though that losing weight, especially for those who are severely obese, poses a significant challenge and that few interventions have been shown to be consistently successful.</p>\r\n<p>Globally, obesity is viewed as a <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/12/being-overweight-not-just-obese-kills-millions-a-year-say-experts\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">growing health problem</a>, with the number of women aged 18 years and older with a BMI greater than 35 having doubled from 50 million to 100 million between 2000 and 2010.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</header></div>', '2017-06-17 15:42:21'),

The terrible <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Grenfell Tower fire</a> in North Kensington was entirely avoidable.</p>\r\n<p>It was not an act of God, but the tragic outcome of a growing void in the responsibility, expertise and single oversight of large construction projects. This has largely come about due to the breaking up of what I would call the triple safety lock around project delivery.</p>\r\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\">\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">Public safety should not be privatised. Putting a monetary value on human lives is unacceptable</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</aside>\r\n<p>The first is building control, ensuring that increasingly complex building regulations are properly implemented. Building control departments in many local authorities have been eviscerated. They are invariably under-resourced with no teeth. Often a subset of planning departments, they lack the authority to carry out what is arguably the most important part of a local authority&rsquo;s remit &ndash; to ensure the safety of its residents.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore this function has been partly privatised, with a range of companies competing for the business. It is often those companies with a reputation for gaining &ldquo;easy&rdquo; approvals that increasingly dominate the market, further undercutting the council building control.</p>\r\n<p>The morale among many council building control officers is extremely low. I completed a small complex project in an inner London borough last year. The council building control officer I worked with was excellent, but told me that he could not cope with his workload, and was unhappy with the way the department was run. He has since left the council.</p>', '2017-06-18 23:53:16');
